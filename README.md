# DigiKala Login Page

This project is a simple login page inspired by the DigiKala login page, built using **Tailwind CSS**. The key features of this project include a responsive layout and dark mode functionality that activates when the device's dark mode is enabled.

## Features

- **Tailwind CSS**: The design is built using Tailwind CSS, which provides utility-first classes for fast and easy styling.
- **Responsive Design**: The page is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Dark Mode**: Dark mode is implemented using Tailwind's dark mode classes. It automatically activates based on the user's system theme preferences (dark or light mode).

## How It Works

- The page layout adjusts dynamically depending on the screen size, thanks to Tailwind's responsive utilities.
- The dark mode is controlled through the `media` strategy of Tailwind CSS, which means it will automatically switch to dark mode if the user's system theme is set to dark mode.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **Responsive design** (via Tailwind's breakpoints)
- **Dark Mode** (via Tailwind's dark mode utilities)
